## How to Use This Template

1. Expand the seeded control families below into the full deployment-specific control inventory.
2. Assign a unique `Control ID` and a named owner to each row.
3. Replace framework references with the actual deployed control implementation where needed.
4. Link each completed test to a result record created from `_TEMPLATE-soc2-control-test-result.md`.
5. Update this matrix whenever new systems, vendors, workflows, or control changes enter scope.

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Planned | Control exists in scope but has not yet been tested in the current cycle |
| In progress | Test execution is underway |
| Pass | Latest test supports operating effectiveness |
| Pass with exception | Control largely operated but exceptions require remediation |
| Fail | Test failed or evidence was insufficient |
| Not applicable | Criterion not in scope for this deployment (justify separately) |
