## Observation

During the postmortem for the desktop onboarding regression (INC-2026-003), mobile onboarding data was reviewed. Mobile Step 3 (workspace configuration) shows a 42% drop-off rate — even higher than the desktop regression peak of 34%. This has been stable at ~42% since the mobile app launch (2025-11-01) and was never addressed because desktop metrics were the primary focus.

Supporting data:
- Mobile Step 1 (account creation): 91% completion
- Mobile Step 2 (profile setup): 84% completion
- Mobile Step 3 (workspace config): 49% completion — 42% drop-off
- Mobile Step 4 (first project): 44% completion

The mobile form presents the same 12-field layout as the pre-fix desktop version, but on a smaller screen where the cognitive load is even higher.

## Initial Assessment

- **Urgency:** next-cycle
- **Strategic alignment:** "Reduce time-to-value for new customers"
- **Potential impact:** high
- **Affected divisions:** core-applications, customer-experience, mobile-engineering

## Notes

The desktop fix (progressive disclosure) should be directly applicable to mobile. However, mobile may need additional UX considerations (e.g., native form components, smaller field set). Filed from retrospective INC-2026-003 follow-up items.
